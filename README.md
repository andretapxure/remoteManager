# Remote connections manager
Now called SSHManager but one of the next features is to write a tab with RDP connections too in the same format (or like) of the ssh config file. The motivation for this is because I did not found any client of this kind for my needs, so I decided to write my own :)
## To do
- Get User dir
- Cross platform with Mac and Ubuntu
- Options tab
  - Option for putty instead of SSH
  - Option for rdesktop istead of mstsc
  - Password saving passwords
